# Classes and Objects

## Assignment

- Open a [Github](www.github.com) Account with your university email. If you already have one please add the university email. 
- Request the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- Clone our course Github [Repository](https://github.com/jdposada/oop_202230) and follow the instructions there

### Optional

It is better if you use Linux OS instead of Windows OS during this course. If you know how to do it attempt to have both installed on your computer. You could also boot linux from a USB or CD following [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#1-getting-started)
