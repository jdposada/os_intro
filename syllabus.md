## Course Description

This course studies the different mechanisms and techniques that make up the basic functions of modern operational systems. The Basics
that will be developed include the study of the operational evolution of the computer systems, process management and coordination; the
deadlocks, their characteristics, prevention, detection and recovery; the physical and virtual memory management; and management mechanisms
secondary storage.

## Course Justification

The Knowledge of operational systems in terms of their design, operation and maintenance, are essential for the Systems Engineer, mainly in
two areas: knowledge of the internal processes of systems operational, allows the engineer its correct parameterization to benefit the performance of applications running on such platform; and the know the mechanisms of communication and synchronization of processes, allows the engineer to develop applications that take advantage of these mechanisms for effective execution. In addition, the Systems Engineer must acquire tools to deal with typical problems related to operational systems such as: purchase, configuration design, assembly of the system, improvement, accounting of the use of resources and planning.

## Main Outcome

Understand the basic design principles and purpose of systems operational, including its internal subsystems, to apply them in the correct
software design and performance evaluation of the latter on existing platforms.

# Learning Outcomes

- **CO1** Know the basic principles of current operating systems: internal structure, subsystems and their responsibilities, means of interaction between the user, the applications and the hardware.

- **CO2** Understand, analyze and evaluate the important internal functions such as: process management, synchronization and concurrency, real memory management, virtual and secondary.

- **CO3** Put into practice the theoretical concepts seen in classes through the implementation of experiences in the Raspberry Pi OS operating system.

- **CO4** Present in written and oral form, with a critical and personal attitude, an essay related to some specialized topic in the area of systems operational.

### ABET Student Outcome

**SO(3)** An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.

# Evaluations and policies

Below the items that will be part of the evaluation of this course. Please check the dates for each one of them on the course schedule


| Item 	| Weight 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| 1st partial Exam 	| 35% 	|
| Preliminary Project	| 10% 	|
| 2nd Partial Exam 	| 30% 	|
| Final Project	| 25% 	|

Please note that:

- All partial exams will be in-person
- Grammar and spelling are just as important as technical aspects.
- The works must be sent by the means specified.
- Send your work in advance, it is possible that a day before (or the day of) delivery there will be power failures.
- Remember, the university campus is enabled for you.
- All e-mail directed concerning the course must be sent specifying to which course do you belong. Answers are usually given within 24 hours. 

## Dev Environment

We will use:

- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/): open source machine emulator and virtualizer
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): open source IDE
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): version control system
    - We have a [Github Repo](https://github.com/jdposada/os_202230) with the code we will use during the course. The GitHub repo also has instructions to configure a local and a remote environment.
- Hardware:
    - [Raspberry Pi version 3B](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus-starter-kit.html). We have this hardware at lab 6K
    - USB to TTL cable. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/ADAFRUIT-Industries-954-Serial-Raspberry/dp/B00DJUHGHI/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=usb+to+ttl&qid=1628486802&sr=8-4)  

## Final Project

The link with the document for the final project will be posted here

### Issues

If you have any issues with the Dev repo, please report it as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/jdposada/oop_202230/issues). In this way everyone that has the same problem will find the solution.

### Office Hours

Please check the Staff tab


### Ethical Code

**Plagiarism or any form of fraud will not be tolerated.**

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. Without exception, if this situation arises, an investigation process involving the students implicated will start, and will act in accordance with the Student Regulations of the Universidad del Norte. 

Plagiarism includes: 
- Using content without proper reference
- Literally or with minimal changes that do not alter the spirit of the text
- Acquire with or without intention, works of third parties and present them partially or totally as their own
- Present group work where some of the members did not work or where there was no demonstrable teamwork
- Other situations defined in the academic [fraud manual of the Universidad del Norte](https://guayacan.uninorte.edu.co/normatividad_interna/upload/File/Guia_Prevencion_Fraude%20estudiantes(5).pdf)


Additionally, all work related to this subject:

- It must be done individually, unless the teacher indicates otherwise. Impersonation is a serious offense.
- It must be done in the time frame specified by the teacher.
- You must reference third-party libraries or algorithms that have been used in the source code.
- It must be sent by the means defined by the teacher (Brightspace/Google Forms). In case of not using the means established for the development of the course, it will be assumed that the work was not sent (this include e-mails).

### Students with Disabilities

Please let me know if you have any documented conditions and we will do our best to provide assistance
